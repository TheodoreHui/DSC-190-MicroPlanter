Angelica likes moist, rich soil that is slightly acid, growing best in semi-shade. It can be grown from seeds, but they must be sown within a few weeks otherwise they lose their viability. Angelica will self seed if seed heads are left on the plant.
Young plants will die back in winter and will need mulching in frost-prone areas. Then they will grow again in spring and produce flowers.
NOTE: Angelica pachycarpa sold as an ornamental garden plant is not edible. It can be distinguished from Angelica archangelica as it has bright shiny leaves."

In temperate/warm areas a well fertilised plant will live for about five years and throw up suckers each year. Artichokes aren't hardy enough to overwinter in areas with very cold winters. In cold areas choose a hardy variety from a local supplier and grow it as an annual, with 10 days' exposure to cool daytime temperatures during spring. Transplant only when all danger of frost is past in your area.

Leave the rest to grow into the leafy ferns (1.5m/5-6ft tall) which will feed the crowns to give a crop next year. In autumn the ferns will be covered in bright red poisonous berries.
Leave the ferns to die down in autumn, then trim off the dead stalks and pile on plenty of rotted manure/compost to give the roots plenty of food to produce new stems in spring.
Harvest by cutting off the stalk, close to the ground. From the third year you can get an additional crop by letting the first lot of ferns grow, then bending down the stalks to break them. A second crop of shoots will grow and can be harvested. Leave subsequent shoots to grow on to ferns. Asparagus does not like continuously wet and warm soil.

There are two main types of broccoli. The purple sprouting is hardier. The heading varieties cope well with warmer weather.
Once a plant opens its yellow flowers then it is generally past eating as the flavour gets a bit overpowering and the plant gets very woody. Harvest them sooner rather than later.
'Broccolini' is a variety grown for the edible stalks. Grow fast with plenty of water and food, and pick as soon as possible."

Brussel Sprouts will not grow good ""sprouts"" in warm areas - they open and are floppy.
In warm areas they are likely to be infested with aphids
Pick formed sprouts from the bottom of the stems leaving the plant growing.
 For winter use in very cold areas, dig up plants that have heads developed and set close together in a cold frame or cellar. Pack soil firmly round the roots. Keep cool but not freezing and they will continue to mature. (Planning an Idaho Vegetable Garden :

Sow seeds close together. This will allow the plants, which blow over easily, to support each other.

Prepare the soil by adding compost which will retain some moisture but not get saturated. Add a small amount of sand to ensure drainage. Water regularly in summer to keep moist. In a pot, in addition to watering to keep moist, water ginger about once a fortnight with a seaweed or other liquid fertilizer.
This perennial will die down in autumn. Remove the dead leaves. In spring lift the root clumps and break them up into smaller pieces to replant.
Harvesting Ginger
You can harvest ginger root after the plant dies down in winter, digging around the plant to cut off a piece of the older root. The young root with shoots is the actively growing plant and should be left to resprout. 
You can also carefully dig down under the plant through the growing season to cut off bits of the older root for use, just be careful not to disturb the rest of the plant too much.
Let plants become well established before harvesting - it is often best to wait until the second growing season.
Make sure that you have edible ginger. Ginger plants sold in nurseries are usually decorative varieties and not suitable for eating. 
Ginger can be grown in pots. The best growing temperature is around 25 - 30C (75-85F)"

Trenches should be about 20-25cm (8-10in) deep. Set the seedlings 10-15  cm (4 - 6in) apart then add enough soil to just cover the roots. As the plants grow fill the trench.
Otherwise - make holes with a dibble or suitable stick 15 cm (6 in) deep and 3-4 cm (1.5 - 2 in) wide. Drop a seedling in each and water enough to cover the roots with soil. As they grow, watering will gradually fill the hole.

Cuttings can be planted directly when danger of frost is past.
Mint can be grown in pots outdoors or indoors
Mint prefers damp, partly shaded areas and once established will grow for many years.
Mint dies down in Winter and sends up new shoots in Spring.
Mint is a rampant grower and will take over a garden bed if not restrained.
One way to contain mint is to use an old bottomless bucket pushed into the ground. The mint won't be able to put its roots out sideways, so will take longer to spread.
If grown in a pot, mint needs to be watered regularly to keep it healthy."

Brown :- strong flavour and pungent. Usually good keepers for storage.
White :- milder but still flavoursome. Keep fairly well.
Red :- Mild, suitable to use raw in salads and sandwiches.
The seedlings should be allowed to gain a bit of strength before planting out - usually 4 to 6 weeks will be enough. When they are big enough to handle, you can plant out. They start off looking like blades of grass.
They don't have to be in a greenhouse (though that would be ideal), any sheltered spot will do. The idea is to guard against rapid changes of temperature, especially at night.
Onions can be bought as young plants (sets or seedlings) from garden shops/nurseries to plant straight into garden beds.
Choose your variety according to your climate and the time of year as some onions will grow better in the cooler months .
Onion bulbs should sit on the surface of the soil. Do not cover.
They will take six to eight months to mature. Onions are ready when the tops start to dry and fall over.
Pull them and leave to dry for a few days.
Store in a cool, dry airy place. Use a net bag or make a string by weaving the tops together."

Use fresh seed and soak seed overnight then, after planting, keep seeds moist until seed germinate. Similar to starting carrots, maybe cover with a wooden plank or mulch until seeds germinate. They will completely fail if the seed dries out after planting and it's not unusual to have an entire packet fail. Difficult to grow in summer as the seed dries out fast and won't germinate.
Leave in the ground until after frost or at least a couple of weeks of really cold weather.
The cold results in the starch in the roots being converted into sugars which give the parsnip its sweet taste. Use a spade to dig the parsnip out of the ground.
Germination rates of parsnip seed are not great so sow about 3 seeds per inch and at a depth of around half an inch. Germination may take up to 20 days.
Thin seedlings down so they are about 8cm (4in) apart. If you are planting in rows then space the rows about 50cm (20in) apart."

Peas need some support when growing, tree prunings with lots of small twigs are a cheap and handy source.
Or else strings between posts or wire netting. the peas need tying in the early stages, until they start producing tendrils and clinging to the support.
Some pea varieties are called 'dwarf' but to make harvesting easier it is a good idea to support the plants.
Pick pea pods while young and pick them often to keep them producing."

				 (Show °C/cm)",Space plants:  12 - 16  inches apart,"Harvest in 15-20 weeks.

Potatoes sold in nurseries and produce stores are certified seed potatoes. Seed potatoes are small potatoes (usually fairly dried up and wrinkled) which are free of viruses and other diseases. You are more likely to get a good crop from certified seed potatoes.
Before planting expose seed potatoes to light to start shoots growing. Avoid direct sun as this can burn or par-cook the seed! Let the potatoes grow shoots up to 1cm long - this can take a few weeks.
In hot or dry climates sprout seed potatoes in seed trays of dampened potting mix.
Large seed tubers can be cut into pieces - just make sure each piece has at least one 'eye' or shoot. Let the cut pieces dry for a few days before planting or else they will probably start rotting.
Growing in the ground
Prepare the soil by digging in plenty of well-rotted animal manure or compost (don't use fresh manure as it will 'burn' plants). Dig a trench for the seed potatoes about 30 - 40cm wide and 10 - 20cm deep. Add a bit more compost/manure to the bottom of the trench and cover with some soil. Put seed potatoes 20 - 30cm apart in the trench, shoot-side up. Fill in the trench to cover the potatoes.
As potato shoots start to appear, cover them up with soil from either side of the trench. 'Hill up the crop' this way a few times in the first four or five weeks of growth, which gives the potatoes an nice loose mound of soil in which to grow. Now leave the shoots to develop on to form leaves.
Keep potatoes well-watered. The soil should be damp enough to stick to your fingers.
No-dig and container growing - ideal for home gardens
If you don't have a ton of space then no-dig and container growing both work well for home garden growing. Using container growing you can produce potatoes in any handy space, even on balconies.
No-dig
Make a no-dig bed of potatoes by layering newspapers (or flattened cardboard boxes) at least six layers thick on an area to be planted. Spread your seed potatoes on top of the newspapers about 30cm apart, trying to get the shoots pointing upwards.
Cover the potatoes with layers of compost, weed-free straw, rotted animal manure, and other mulch materials, until the potatoes are covered by about 20 - 30cm. Don't flatten the cover down.
Water well. As the potatoes start to grow through, add more layers of mulch material and keep watered. After about four weeks of growing through and covering up, let the potatoes grow on without covering. As the mulch breaks down keep adding more mulch to keep the tubers covered.
Container growing
Get a container at least 40 - 50 cm deep with holes in the bottom for drainage. Shrub-sized flower pots work well. An old wheelbarrow will work if holes are drilled in the bottom. You can also make a 'container' using loose bricks or chicken wire.
Put about 10 - 20cm of mixed compost and potting mix in the bottom of the container and put your seed potatoes on top, about 30cm apart. Cover with about 10 - 20cm of compost mixed with mulch (straw, grass clippings. Water well.
As the potato shoots start to grow through, cover up with more compost and mulch mix and keep watered. Keep on covering up for about four weeks (but stop if you reach the top of the container!)
For both no-dig and container growing, keep the mulch well watered - wet enough to stick to your fingers but not sopping. If the potatoes dry out they will probably go scabby.

The longer potatoes grow, the bigger the tubers will be.
Don't grow potatoes in the same place as other solanum crops as they share many diseases - for example, don't grow potatoes to follow a tomato crop, or vice-versa.
You can start harvesting a few tubers as soon as they are big enough to eat - dig around under the plants and retrieve a few, and cover up the rest to keep growing.
Potatoes exposed to light will go green, so keep them covered up with straw and soil as they grow. Green potatoes are poisonous!
Potatoes accumulate cadmium and other heavy metals, so avoid fertilizers which contain these elements. Similarly, avoid using tyres as containers for growing potatoes as they can leach heavy metals."

Buttercup are small to medium round pumpkins with dark green skin.
There are a number of large pumpkins, some round and flattish - good for storage and eating - others will produce the ""Cinderella coach"" type giant round fruit which are not such good eating.
Harvest when the vines die off and the pumpkins' stalks are dry. Leave a small piece of stalk attached to the fruit to prevent damp causing rot. The fruit can be stored  for months in a cool airy place. In some parts of New Zealand, they are stored on shed roofs. 
Pumpkins sometimes need hand pollination if the fruit are not setting well or die off after starting to grow, try picking a male flower (straight stem) and gently brushing pollen inside female flowers."

Rhubarb can be left in the ground and will return a crop for many years, at least 10 to 15 years (We have one that is more than 20 yrs old).  Rhubarb is quite a hardy crop but the crown will rot if in heavy wet clay soils. It can cope with dry periods.
Plant in good soil and remove as many weeds as possible. Do not disturb rhubarb roots when cultivating round the plant.
Better in cooler climates, but can be grown in shady areas of warm climates.
You can lift and divide rhubarb to make more plants . It is best to do this when the plant is dormant ( or at least less actively growing) in winter or late autumn.
It is best to wait until a plant is about 5 years old before dividing the crown but it can be moved at any age. Some of the root structure will be damaged when lifting it, so stalk production will not be so good for a few months.
If you have mild winters and your rhubarb is still producing new stalks, you can continue to pick it.
Although rhubarb is used in desserts and jams, it is considered a vegetable because the stalks are used not the fruit.
NB Do not eat the leaves or roots as they contain oxalic acid which is poisonous. They should not be fed to poultry or stock either.
Remove flower stalks as they appear as the plant will stop producing leaf stalks when flowering.
Rhubarb can be 'forced' by covering dormant crowns with clay pots or a cloche in early spring."

Sow seeds thinly on seed raising mix/compost. Cover with a thin layer of  compost and water in.
Keep under cover, either in a greenhouse or indoors near a window. Germination takes 2 to 8 weeks. Plant out into small pots to grow on when 3 leaves have appeared. Then transplant to garden when well grown.
After about a year the strawberries will form low-growing leafy plants,between 12 - 15cm (about 6 inches) high and will spread to about 50 - 100cm (20 - 40 inches). They have five petalled flowers, usually white or sometimes pink. The flowers are followed by delicious red fruits which have their seeds on the outside.

Protect your plants with some sort of netting or bird scarer or you will lose most of your crop. 
Strawberries like  well drained soil with plenty of humus. To prepare your bed, dig in some compost before planting and possibly use a liquid fertiliser during the growing season. Well fed strawberries taste better.
To protect the fruit from moulds use some form of mulch around the plants. Straw, pine needles, or black plastic are all suitable. Mulch will also help suppress weeds."

There is nothing like the taste of a freshly picked tomato, warm from the sunshine. In the smallest of gardens or even an apartment with a window-box, it is worth growing at least one tomato plant for the pleasure it will give you. They will grow in pots, troughs or even hanging baskets. 
Tomatoes should be grown in shelter or under cover in cool climates.

Tomatoes need feeding. In a garden bed, compost and mulching will produce a crop from one or two plants. In containers, use some suitable long term fertiliser pellets or feed regularly when you water. Feeding also improves the flavour of the fruit.

When you plant out, put the seedlings in a deep holes, up to the top set of leaves. The  covered stems will put out extra roots and you will have a stronger, healthier plant.
There are many different varieties of tomatoes but they all have one of two growth habits.
Determinate:
Compact bush growth, stops at a specific height and useful for containers. If left without supporting stakes, they will form a dense carpet which excludes weeds and keeps the soil cool and damp. 
Indeterminate:
Will continue growing a main stem, or vine until stopped by frost. The majority of heirloom tomatoes are indeterminate. 
Both types need stakes to give them some support otherwise they will sprawl across the garden.
Varieties include Acid-free, Bush, Tall, Cherry, Yellow and many others."

Fruit production is highest when night temperatures range from 59-68F (15-20C).
Plant in a warm, unused corner of the garden. Leave the shoot sticking out of the ground and it will take off.
Choko needs a long growing season, about 4 - 6 months but in that time it will spread and can be useful to cover old sheds or fences! 
An average household would need one or two plants.
Leaves rather like cucumber and some prickles on the fruit. 
Some variation in fruit, with lighter green and few prickles depending on variety. The differences seem to be between countries eg USA, Australia, Malta."

It can be grown indoors in pots in cool/temperate areas. To grow well it needs lots of water and nutrients.
Prepare the soil by adding compost which will retain some moisture but not get saturated. Add a small amount of sand to ensure drainage. Water regularly in summer to keep moist. In a pot, in addition to watering to keep moist, water ginger about once a fortnight with a seaweed or other liquid fertilizer.
This perennial will die down in autumn. Remove the dead leaves. In spring lift the root clumps and break them up into smaller pieces to replant.
Harvesting Ginger
You can harvest ginger root after the plant dies down in winter, digging around the plant to cut off a piece of the older root. The young root with shoots is the actively growing plant and should be left to resprout. 
You can also carefully dig down under the plant through the growing season to cut off bits of the older root for use, just be careful not to disturb the rest of the plant too much.
Let plants become well established before harvesting - it is often best to wait until the second growing season.
Make sure that you have edible ginger. Ginger plants sold in nurseries are usually decorative varieties and not suitable for eating. 
Ginger can be grown in pots. The best growing temperature is around 25 - 30C (75-85F)"

Trenches should be about 20-25cm (8-10in) deep. Set the seedlings 10-15  cm (4 - 6in) apart then add enough soil to just cover the roots. As the plants grow fill the trench.
Otherwise - make holes with a dibble or suitable stick 15 cm (6 in) deep and 3-4 cm (1.5 - 2 in) wide. Drop a seedling in each and water enough to cover the roots with soil. As they grow, watering will gradually fill the hole.

Brown :- strong flavour and pungent. Usually good keepers for storage.
White :- milder but still flavoursome. Keep fairly well.
Red :- Mild, suitable to use raw in salads and sandwiches.
The seedlings should be allowed to gain a bit of strength before planting out - usually 4 to 6 weeks will be enough. When they are big enough to handle, you can plant out. They start off looking like blades of grass.
They don't have to be in a greenhouse (though that would be ideal), any sheltered spot will do. The idea is to guard against rapid changes of temperature, especially at night.
Onions can be bought as young plants (sets or seedlings) from garden shops/nurseries to plant straight into garden beds.
Choose your variety according to your climate and the time of year as some onions will grow better in the cooler months .
Onion bulbs should sit on the surface of the soil. Do not cover.
They will take six to eight months to mature. Onions are ready when the tops start to dry and fall over.
Pull them and leave to dry for a few days.
Store in a cool, dry airy place. Use a net bag or make a string by weaving the tops together."

Leave in the ground until after frost or at least a couple of weeks of really cold weather.
The cold results in the starch in the roots being converted into sugars which give the parsnip its sweet taste. Use a spade to dig the parsnip out of the ground.
Germination rates of parsnip seed are not great so sow about 3 seeds per inch and at a depth of around half an inch. Germination may take up to 20 days.

Potatoes sold in nurseries and produce stores are certified seed potatoes. Seed potatoes are small potatoes (usually fairly dried up and wrinkled) which are free of viruses and other diseases. You are more likely to get a good crop from certified seed potatoes.
Before planting expose seed potatoes to light to start shoots growing. Avoid direct sun as this can burn or par-cook the seed! Let the potatoes grow shoots up to 1cm long - this can take a few weeks.
In hot or dry climates sprout seed potatoes in seed trays of dampened potting mix.
Large seed tubers can be cut into pieces - just make sure each piece has at least one 'eye' or shoot. Let the cut pieces dry for a few days before planting or else they will probably start rotting.
Growing in the ground
Prepare the soil by digging in plenty of well-rotted animal manure or compost (don't use fresh manure as it will 'burn' plants). Dig a trench for the seed potatoes about 30 - 40cm wide and 10 - 20cm deep. Add a bit more compost/manure to the bottom of the trench and cover with some soil. Put seed potatoes 20 - 30cm apart in the trench, shoot-side up. Fill in the trench to cover the potatoes.
As potato shoots start to appear, cover them up with soil from either side of the trench. 'Hill up the crop' this way a few times in the first four or five weeks of growth, which gives the potatoes an nice loose mound of soil in which to grow. Now leave the shoots to develop on to form leaves.
Keep potatoes well-watered. The soil should be damp enough to stick to your fingers.
No-dig and container growing - ideal for home gardens
If you don't have a ton of space then no-dig and container growing both work well for home garden growing. Using container growing you can produce potatoes in any handy space, even on balconies.
No-dig
Make a no-dig bed of potatoes by layering newspapers (or flattened cardboard boxes) at least six layers thick on an area to be planted. Spread your seed potatoes on top of the newspapers about 30cm apart, trying to get the shoots pointing upwards.
Cover the potatoes with layers of compost, weed-free straw, rotted animal manure, and other mulch materials, until the potatoes are covered by about 20 - 30cm. Don't flatten the cover down.
Water well. As the potatoes start to grow through, add more layers of mulch material and keep watered. After about four weeks of growing through and covering up, let the potatoes grow on without covering. As the mulch breaks down keep adding more mulch to keep the tubers covered.
Container growing
Get a container at least 40 - 50 cm deep with holes in the bottom for drainage. Shrub-sized flower pots work well. An old wheelbarrow will work if holes are drilled in the bottom. You can also make a 'container' using loose bricks or chicken wire.
Put about 10 - 20cm of mixed compost and potting mix in the bottom of the container and put your seed potatoes on top, about 30cm apart. Cover with about 10 - 20cm of compost mixed with mulch (straw, grass clippings. Water well.
As the potato shoots start to grow through, cover up with more compost and mulch mix and keep watered. Keep on covering up for about four weeks (but stop if you reach the top of the container!)
For both no-dig and container growing, keep the mulch well watered - wet enough to stick to your fingers but not sopping. If the potatoes dry out they will probably go scabby.

The longer potatoes grow, the bigger the tubers will be.
Don't grow potatoes in the same place as other solanum crops as they share many diseases - for example, don't grow potatoes to follow a tomato crop, or vice-versa.
You can start harvesting a few tubers as soon as they are big enough to eat - dig around under the plants and retrieve a few, and cover up the rest to keep growing.
Potatoes exposed to light will go green, so keep them covered up with straw and soil as they grow. Green potatoes are poisonous!
Potatoes accumulate cadmium and other heavy metals, so avoid fertilizers which contain these elements. Similarly, avoid using tyres as containers for growing potatoes as they can leach heavy metals."

Buttercup are small to medium round pumpkins with dark green skin.
There are a number of large pumpkins, some round and flattish - good for storage and eating - others will produce the ""Cinderella coach"" type giant round fruit which are not such good eating.
Harvest when the vines die off and the pumpkins' stalks are dry. Leave a small piece of stalk attached to the fruit to prevent damp causing rot. The fruit can be stored  for months in a cool airy place. In some parts of New Zealand, they are stored on shed roofs. 
Pumpkins sometimes need hand pollination if the fruit are not setting well or die off after starting to grow, try picking a male flower (straight stem) and gently brushing pollen inside female flowers."

Rhubarb can be left in the ground and will return a crop for many years, at least 10 to 15 years (We have one that is more than 20 yrs old).  Rhubarb is quite a hardy crop but the crown will rot if in heavy wet clay soils. It can cope with dry periods.
Plant in good soil and remove as many weeds as possible. Do not disturb rhubarb roots when cultivating round the plant.
Better in cooler climates, but can be grown in shady areas of warm climates.
You can lift and divide rhubarb to make more plants . It is best to do this when the plant is dormant ( or at least less actively growing) in winter or late autumn.
It is best to wait until a plant is about 5 years old before dividing the crown but it can be moved at any age. Some of the root structure will be damaged when lifting it, so stalk production will not be so good for a few months.
If you have mild winters and your rhubarb is still producing new stalks, you can continue to pick it.
Although rhubarb is used in desserts and jams, it is considered a vegetable because the stalks are used not the fruit.
NB Do not eat the leaves or roots as they contain oxalic acid which is poisonous. They should not be fed to poultry or stock either.
Remove flower stalks as they appear as the plant will stop producing leaf stalks when flowering.
Rhubarb can be 'forced' by covering dormant crowns with clay pots or a cloche in early spring."

Chill the seeds, in a closed jar or plastic box,   2 - 4 weeks in a home freezer. Allow to return to room temperature in the closed container before sowing.
Sow seeds thinly on seed raising mix/compost. Cover with a thin layer of  compost and water in.
Keep under cover, either in a greenhouse or indoors near a window. Germination takes 2 to 8 weeks. Plant out into small pots to grow on when 3 leaves have appeared. Then transplant to garden when well grown.
After about a year the strawberries will form low-growing leafy plants,between 12 - 15cm (about 6 inches) high and will spread to about 50 - 100cm (20 - 40 inches). They have five petalled flowers, usually white or sometimes pink. The flowers are followed by delicious red fruits which have their seeds on the outside. Later in the season, the plants send out runners like thin stems across the garden. They will take root to form new plants.
Protect your plants with some sort of netting or bird scarer or you will lose most of your crop. 
Strawberries like  well drained soil with plenty of humus. To prepare your bed, dig in some compost before planting and possibly use a liquid fertiliser during the growing season. Well fed strawberries taste better.
To protect the fruit from moulds use some form of mulch around the plants. Straw, pine needles, or black plastic are all suitable. Mulch will also help suppress weeds."

Seeds need to be started in a warm frost- free place. A greenhouse is ideal. Keep under cover until about 10cm (4in) high, then harden off by putting outside during the day and inside at night for about a week. Transplant the young plants into their final positions, in well-drained soil in full sunlight. Harvest sparingly in the first year. 
Root divisions, from 3 or 4 year old plants, can be taken in late Spring and then planted into a sunny spot. 
Water sparingly once established and avoid feeding. The plants will have most flavour in  Summer months.
Thyme dies down in the winter, if frosty, but a good layer of mulch round the plant will protect the roots and provide enough food to keep it growing."

Tomatillos are from the same family as Cape Gooseberries, with a papery husk round the fruit. 
Tomatillo plants are similar in growth to tomatoes and spread about 1 -1.5m . Can be supported but are happy spreading themselves around.
The plants are very productive so 2 or 3 plants may be enough for the average household.
Tomatillos will cope with cooler weather than tomatoes. 
The fruit will swell to fill the husk as they ripen. 
Do not use fertiliser.
When buying seed, check that it is Ph. ixocarpa not Ph.peruviana otherwise you will grow Cape Gooseberries instead of Tomatillos."

There is nothing like the taste of a freshly picked tomato, warm from the sunshine. In the smallest of gardens or even an apartment with a window-box, it is worth growing at least one tomato plant for the pleasure it will give you. They will grow in pots, troughs or even hanging baskets. 
Tomatoes should be grown in shelter or under cover in cool climates.

Tomatoes need feeding. In a garden bed, compost and mulching will produce a crop from one or two plants. In containers, use some suitable long term fertiliser pellets or feed regularly when you water. Feeding also improves the flavour of the fruit.

When you plant out, put the seedlings in a deep holes, up to the top set of leaves. The  covered stems will put out extra roots and you will have a stronger, healthier plant.
There are many different varieties of tomatoes but they all have one of two growth habits.
Determinate:
Compact bush growth, stops at a specific height and useful for containers. If left without supporting stakes, they will form a dense carpet which excludes weeds and keeps the soil cool and damp. 
Indeterminate:
Will continue growing a main stem, or vine until stopped by frost. The majority of heirloom tomatoes are indeterminate. 
Both types need stakes to give them some support otherwise they will sprawl across the garden.
Varieties include Acid-free, Bush, Tall, Cherry, Yellow and many others."

If there are no bees around and  the fruit are not setting well or die off after starting to grow, try picking a male flower (straight stem) and gently brushing pollen inside female flowers.
Blackjack is the most popular green variety.
