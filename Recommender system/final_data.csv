Can be propagated by suckers or offsets.
In temperate/warm areas a well fertilised plant will live for about five years and throw up suckers each year. Artichokes aren't hardy enough to overwinter in areas with very cold winters. In cold areas choose a hardy variety from a local supplier and grow it as an annual, with 10 days' exposure to cool daytime temperatures during spring.

Harvest the shoots which are bigger than 1-2cm/half-inch in diameter. Leave the rest to grow into the leafy ferns (1.5m/5-6ft tall) which will feed the crowns to give a crop next year. In autumn the ferns will be covered in bright red poisonous berries.
Leave the ferns to die down in autumn, then trim off the dead stalks and pile on plenty of rotted manure/compost to give the roots plenty of food to produce new stems in spring.
Harvest by cutting off the stalk, close to the ground. From the third year you can get an additional crop by letting the first lot of ferns grow, then bending down the stalks to break them. A second crop of shoots will grow and can be harvested. Leave subsequent shoots to grow on to ferns. Asparagus does not like continuously wet and warm soil.

Prepare the soil by adding compost which will retain some moisture but not get saturated. Add a small amount of sand to ensure drainage. Water regularly in summer to keep moist. In a pot, in addition to watering to keep moist, water ginger about once a fortnight with a seaweed or other liquid fertilizer.
This perennial will die down in autumn. Remove the dead leaves. In spring lift the root clumps and break them up into smaller pieces to replant.
Harvesting Ginger
You can harvest ginger root after the plant dies down in winter, digging around the plant to cut off a piece of the older root. The young root with shoots is the actively growing plant and should be left to resprout. 
You can also carefully dig down under the plant through the growing season to cut off bits of the older root for use, just be careful not to disturb the rest of the plant too much.
Let plants become well established before harvesting - it is often best to wait until the second growing season.
Make sure that you have edible ginger. Ginger plants sold in nurseries are usually decorative varieties and not suitable for eating. 
Ginger can be grown in pots. The best growing temperature is around 25 - 30C (75-85F)",68,86,6,6,175,175,set(),set(),set(),set(),set(),2022-10-24 11:16:45.557022

61,Potato,"Seed potatoes
Potatoes sold in nurseries and produce stores are certified seed potatoes. Seed potatoes are small potatoes (usually fairly dried up and wrinkled) which are free of viruses and other diseases. You are more likely to get a good crop from certified seed potatoes.
Before planting expose seed potatoes to light to start shoots growing. Avoid direct sun as this can burn or par-cook the seed! Let the potatoes grow shoots up to 1cm long - this can take a few weeks.
In hot or dry climates sprout seed potatoes in seed trays of dampened potting mix.
Large seed tubers can be cut into pieces - just make sure each piece has at least one 'eye' or shoot. Let the cut pieces dry for a few days before planting or else they will probably start rotting.
Growing in the ground
Prepare the soil by digging in plenty of well-rotted animal manure or compost (don't use fresh manure as it will 'burn' plants). Dig a trench for the seed potatoes about 30 - 40cm wide and 10 - 20cm deep. Add a bit more compost/manure to the bottom of the trench and cover with some soil. Put seed potatoes 20 - 30cm apart in the trench, shoot-side up. Fill in the trench to cover the potatoes.
As potato shoots start to appear, cover them up with soil from either side of the trench. 'Hill up the crop' this way a few times in the first four or five weeks of growth, which gives the potatoes an nice loose mound of soil in which to grow. Now leave the shoots to develop on to form leaves.
Keep potatoes well-watered. The soil should be damp enough to stick to your fingers.
No-dig and container growing - ideal for home gardens
If you don't have a ton of space then no-dig and container growing both work well for home garden growing. Using container growing you can produce potatoes in any handy space, even on balconies.
No-dig
Make a no-dig bed of potatoes by layering newspapers (or flattened cardboard boxes) at least six layers thick on an area to be planted. Spread your seed potatoes on top of the newspapers about 30cm apart, trying to get the shoots pointing upwards.
Cover the potatoes with layers of compost, weed-free straw, rotted animal manure, and other mulch materials, until the potatoes are covered by about 20 - 30cm. Don't flatten the cover down.
Water well. As the potatoes start to grow through, add more layers of mulch material and keep watered. After about four weeks of growing through and covering up, let the potatoes grow on without covering. As the mulch breaks down keep adding more mulch to keep the tubers covered.
Container growing
Get a container at least 40 - 50 cm deep with holes in the bottom for drainage. Shrub-sized flower pots work well. An old wheelbarrow will work if holes are drilled in the bottom. You can also make a 'container' using loose bricks or chicken wire.
Put about 10 - 20cm of mixed compost and potting mix in the bottom of the container and put your seed potatoes on top, about 30cm apart. Cover with about 10 - 20cm of compost mixed with mulch (straw, grass clippings. Water well.
As the potato shoots start to grow through, cover up with more compost and mulch mix and keep watered. Keep on covering up for about four weeks (but stop if you reach the top of the container!)
For both no-dig and container growing, keep the mulch well watered - wet enough to stick to your fingers but not sopping. If the potatoes dry out they will probably go scabby.

The longer potatoes grow, the bigger the tubers will be.
Don't grow potatoes in the same place as other solanum crops as they share many diseases - for example, don't grow potatoes to follow a tomato crop, or vice-versa.
You can start harvesting a few tubers as soon as they are big enough to eat - dig around under the plants and retrieve a few, and cover up the rest to keep growing.
Potatoes exposed to light will go green, so keep them covered up with straw and soil as they grow. Green potatoes are poisonous!
Potatoes accumulate cadmium and other heavy metals, so avoid fertilizers which contain these elements. Similarly, avoid using tyres as containers for growing potatoes as they can leach heavy metals.",50,86,12,16,105,140,"{'beans', 'peas', 'sweetcorn', 'brassicas', 'marigolds', 'broad beans', 'nasturtiums'}",set(),set(),"{4, 5}","{'sunflowers', 'cucumber', 'rosemary', 'pumpkin', 'tomatoes'}",2022-10-24 11:17:19.551180

Plant in good soil and remove as many weeds as possible. Do not disturb rhubarb roots when cultivating round the plant.
Better in cooler climates, but can be grown in shady areas of warm climates.
You can lift and divide rhubarb to make more plants . It is best to do this when the plant is dormant ( or at least less actively growing) in winter or late autumn.
It is best to wait until a plant is about 5 years old before dividing the crown but it can be moved at any age. Some of the root structure will be damaged when lifting it, so stalk production will not be so good for a few months.
If you have mild winters and your rhubarb is still producing new stalks, you can continue to pick it.
Although rhubarb is used in desserts and jams, it is considered a vegetable because the stalks are used not the fruit.
NB Do not eat the leaves or roots as they contain oxalic acid which is poisonous. They should not be fed to poultry or stock either.

80,Strawberries,"Alpine strawberries are the easiest to grow from seed. They produce tiny, triangular fruit with an intense flavour. 
Chill the seeds, in a closed jar or plastic box,   2 - 4 weeks in a home freezer. Allow to return to room temperature in the closed container before sowing.
Sow seeds thinly on seed raising mix/compost. Cover with a thin layer of  compost and water in.
Keep under cover, either in a greenhouse or indoors near a window. Germination takes 2 to 8 weeks. Plant out into small pots to grow on when 3 leaves have appeared. Then transplant to garden when well grown.
After about a year the strawberries will form low-growing leafy plants,between 12 - 15cm (about 6 inches) high and will spread to about 50 - 100cm (20 - 40 inches). They have five petalled flowers, usually white or sometimes pink. The flowers are followed by delicious red fruits which have their seeds on the outside. Later in the season, the plants send out runners like thin stems across the garden. They will take root to form new plants.
Protect your plants with some sort of netting or bird scarer or you will lose most of your crop. 
Strawberries like  well drained soil with plenty of humus. To prepare your bed, dig in some compost before planting and possibly use a liquid fertiliser during the growing season. Well fed strawberries taste better.

89,Tomato,"TOMATOES

There is nothing like the taste of a freshly picked tomato, warm from the sunshine. In the smallest of gardens or even an apartment with a window-box, it is worth growing at least one tomato plant for the pleasure it will give you. They will grow in pots, troughs or even hanging baskets. 
Tomatoes should be grown in shelter or under cover in cool climates.

Tomatoes need feeding. In a garden bed, compost and mulching will produce a crop from one or two plants. In containers, use some suitable long term fertiliser pellets or feed regularly when you water. Feeding also improves the flavour of the fruit.

When you plant out, put the seedlings in a deep holes, up to the top set of leaves. The  covered stems will put out extra roots and you will have a stronger, healthier plant.
There are many different varieties of tomatoes but they all have one of two growth habits.
Determinate:
Compact bush growth, stops at a specific height and useful for containers. If left without supporting stakes, they will form a dense carpet which excludes weeds and keeps the soil cool and damp. 
Indeterminate:
Will continue growing a main stem, or vine until stopped by frost. The majority of heirloom tomatoes are indeterminate. 
Both types need stakes to give them some support otherwise they will sprawl across the garden.
